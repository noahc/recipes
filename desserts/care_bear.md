### Instructions

Care Bear Throw Up is as much science as it is art. As a general suggestion, start with equal parts
Fruit Loops, Whip Cream, and Crushed Pineapple. 

* Drain the Crushed Pineapple
* THE REALLY FUN PART!!! Take two paper plates, and put a bunch of fruit loops between them. Now, put this on the floor. Next, smash it with your foot! Really hard! Crush to desired granularity.
* Mix crushed pineapple, whip cream, and fruit loops together.
* Enjoy!
